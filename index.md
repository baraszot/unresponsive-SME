# Your subject matter expert does not answer your emails - what you can do

You work on a technical writing project. You need to ask your subject matter expert about something. You wrote them an e-mail and you wait for the answer from the expert. If the expert does not answer, you can do these things.

## Try to contact your expert again

**You can do these things:**

- Send them another e-mail.
- Use Slack or a phone to send them a message.
- Use a phone to call them.
- Ask what the problem is with the expert. (You can ask someone who works with the expert more often.)


*Note:*
- *Maybe the expert got too many emails.*
- *Maybe the expert does not like to write emails.*
- *Maybe the expert is very busy or not at work at the moment.*
- *If you talk to the expert, you can ask the expert what you can do to make your work with the expert better.*



## When you write another message to your expert

**You should do these things:**

- Describe what you need from the expert and when you need it for.
- Suggest a date for a meeting or a call you can have with the expert.
- If you have an online calendar, share the calendar with your expert.

*Note:*

*If you give more information to your expert, it will be easier for the expert to answer.*


## How to prepare for a meeting with the expert

**You can do these things:**

- Read the documentation of older or similar products.
- Plan your work. Have enough time to do the work.
- Ask them for permission to record the meeting.
- Take good notes during the meeting.

*Note:*

*If you prepare well for the meeting, the expert will respect you more.*
