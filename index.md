# Your subject matter expert does not answer your emails - what you can do

You work on a technical writing project. You need to ask your subject matter expert about something. You wrote them an e-mail and you wait for the answer from the expert. The expert does not answer. Do these things.

## Contact your expert

**You can do these things now and quickly:**

- Send them an e-mail again.
- Use Slack or a phone to send them a message.
- Use a phone to call them.

*Think about these things:*
- Maybe the expert got too many emails.
- Maybe the expert does not like to write emails.

**For the long run:** Befriend them. No need for you to be best buddies, but chances are making your relationship more personal will make the work run smoother. Take interest in what they do, and not just the part your boss pays you to be interested in. You may find an area where your expertise might be of use to your SME (some proofreading maybe?). A history of exchanged favors will make asking for help easier in the future. Don't be discouraged if you don't seem to have too much in common. This is about trying to bring a more personal dimension to your interactions, not about making them your close friend. But then again who knows, maybe you will become close friends in the process?

## Make sure you're not the problem

**Quick fix:** Don't just resend the original message. Look through it and edit if needed. Have you given them a good idea of what you'd need from them and when? Proposed a possible date for a meeting or a call? A timeframe? A deadline? Have you got an online calendar that you can share with them? Take some initiative in offering them options on how the two of you can kick off with the work to be done.

**For the long run:** Do your research before you engage with them. The documentation of older or similar products are usually good sources to get a grasp of what you'd be working on. Come prepared. Nobody likes to have their time wasted by someone who hasn't made an effort on their end. If you have a meeting, take good notes and, if you get their permission, record the conversation so that you don't have to bother them with something you know you've covered but can't properly remember. Plan your work well. Do not procrastinate in the hope that they will be okay with helping you out at the very last minute. And don't save your best writing skills for the documentation, write good e-mails as well: simple (a study in e-mail responsiveness has shown that a reading level of a nine year old is the most optimal if you want a reply), concise and organized.

## Find out what the problem is

**Quick fix:** If they don't respond to any reminders you have sent their way and you've no idea why, you may try contacting someone who's closer to them and might have more insight on what's stopping them. Maybe they're away or really swamped with other work, maybe a plague has hit their kid's preschool or maybe, perish the thought, they just avoid writers like the plague. Either way, knowing what's up will make it easier to choose appropriate strategy for your next message.

**For the long run:** If their unresponsiveness is a recurring problem, talk to them. Ask if there's something you can do to improve. Explain your perspective and carefully listen to theirs. You're in this product-making boat together, so hopefully you work out a system that works for the both of you.
